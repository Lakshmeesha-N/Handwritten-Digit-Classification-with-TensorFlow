# Handwritten Digit Classification with TensorFlow

## Introduction
This project aims to classify handwritten digits using a neural network implemented with TensorFlow. The dataset used is the popular MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Dataset
- **Source:** MNIST dataset
- **Number of samples:** 70,000 (60,000 training and 10,000 testing)
- **Image size:** 28x28 pixels
